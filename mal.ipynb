    "In the local elections of 2021, around 100 candidates stood for election for the city council of Horsens. 83 of them represented a national party, had more than one candidate and provided answers to the <a href=\"https://www.dr.dk/nyheder/politik/kandidattest\">DR Candidate Test</a>, a test designed to help voters find out who they should vote for. In this test, the candidates answered 18 questions, which we will use as features in the following. The politicians belong to 9 parties, which will be our classes.\n",

    "Meanwhile, `X_Horsens.npy` contains the answers to the test as numbers between -1.5 and 1.5, such that -1.5 is \"Strongly disagree\", -0.5 is \"Disagree\", 0.5 is \"Agree\" and 1.5 is \"Strongly agree\".
